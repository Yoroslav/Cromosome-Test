Description:

Chromosome Test is a 2D game in which you survive on an island in order to collect your own chromosomes in a limited time and have time to get into the portal in a limited time too!
Be quick and careful that there are enemies who will take away your chromosomes and still have time to collect more than 46 chromosomes,
If you don't have time, you end up in the basement (unfortunately, there are no basements, but you just start playing again)!
